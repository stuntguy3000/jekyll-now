# Laugh Lab 2022
Laugh Lab is a two-and-a-half-hour show with the promise to introduce audiences to a variety of new and upcoming comedians. The show rotates through a selection of random comedians, hosted by an MC who runs through the evening.

This year, I got to experience Laugh Lab for the first time with friends. Our session was hosted by [Rudy-Lee Rudes Taurua](https://www.instagram.com/rudyboy91/?hl=en), a beautiful loud mouth head-tattooed man full of bogan charisma. Safe to say, we walked into the show with no idea what we were getting into.

Rudy did his introduction, and we were all nervously laughing along - feeling a level of confusion, and regret but also somewhat intrigued about what's next to come. Over the next two hours, we got to see a handful of amazing, awkward and unique comedians doing their best to make us laugh. It's safe to say, we were all blown away by the comics. Apart from the occasional flop, the jokes were solid, the variety was as big as it gets.

We enjoyed being able to attend an open mic night show and being able to support the local and upcoming comedy scene was something special.

I can't say for sure how it happened, but one thing lead to another, as a group we got to spend a good few hours talking to many of the comics who performed on the stage that evening. We got a chance to meet the people behind the jokes and learn so much more about the comedy scene, and how it all comes together.

Speaking with Rudy, and other amazing comics like [Takashi Wakasugi](https://www.instagram.com/waka_waka_yay_yay) and [Shad Wicka](https://www.instagram.com/wickedshad) was an amazing and unique experience. These were people that I already followed on Tik-Tok but knew nothing about. It was an amazing chance to get a deeper understanding of why they are comedians & what they love about the job.

I'll be coming back, and I can't wait to hear new jokes, meet new comics, and dive deeper into the comedy scene in Adelaide and beyond.
