# Dom Chambers - A Boy and His Deck
After appearing on 'Penn & Teller: Fool Us' & 'America's Got Talent', Dom Chambers returned to the Adelaide Fringe with an encore of his sold-out, award-winning show, A Boy and His Deck. The show is performed with all the charisma and charm that Dom is known for, whilst focusing on his journey from a child fascinated with magic, to a full-time magician and performer.

# My complicated relationship with magic shows
Admittedly, my standards for magic shows are rather high. I am always analysing what I am watching, trying to think two or three steps ahead of the magician. I have seen bad shows, where magicians pretend to levitate using poorly hidden platforms, and I have seen close sleight of hand that left me stunned and amazed. 

Because of these preconditions, I do not usually see many magic shows at the Adelaide Fringe – unless I know they are going to be good. I also prefer magic shows that incorporate good storytelling and have a comedic side to them. 

Amazing comics like Simon Taylor, who I see year after year, always find a way to slip in a card trick or two – which hits the spot.

# Returning for an encore
I previously saw this same show back last year – and walked away with a smile on my face. It was, by far, the most enjoyable, confusing, funny, and just incredible comedy magic performance I have seen at the Adelaide Fringe. This year, I recommended Dom Chambers to my mates, and we went as a group. 

Going into the show, I realised I only remembered key bits of the show from last year. I was looking forward to seeing the tricks again and giving my mates a chance to experience the same magic that blew my mind last year. 

Once things got underway, key pieces and tricks came back. It was unique to see the show again, this time trying to focus my efforts on certain moments that I knew were about to happen. Even with this prior knowledge, and my expectations, I was still thoroughly blown away by most of the tricks. To my surprise, some of the tricks became even more confusing after seeing them for a second time! I was able to figure out some details but was mostly still left in the dark.

The show was like I remembered, totally incredibly in every way. From the constantly comedic storytelling to mind-blowing magic tricks, it was a piece of art from start to finish that left us all in stitches & a world of magic and wonder.

All my mates were blown away by every piece of the performance. We all left not knowing how to explain pretty much every trick, only having a true feeling of wonder and confusion.

This is full credit to Dom, his magical abilities, and his overall showmanship. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing him perform live and cannot wait to see what he does next!
